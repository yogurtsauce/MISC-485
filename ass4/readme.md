## How it works

CreateTables.py will run the create table queries found in input/queries.

Insert.py will insert data from input/data.

Queries.py will run specificied queries and put the results into output/queries.

Eventually the main.py will be updated to import the functions and the creation of tables/inserts/queries will all be in there.

## Assignment Requirements

**Question 1:**

    E8.2 in Chapter 8. (Note: 1st Edition: there are some typos in Figure 8.43. In Figure 8.46, please remove any space inside a field name). Please do E8.2a (manually populate the tables in Figure 8.42), E8.2b, and E8.2c. No SQLs are needed.

    Note: please add ticket type ID for TicketType dimension.

    Submit your answers in one Word file.

**Question 2:**

    Step 1: Use Access to create the operational database (E8.2) City Police Department and input sample data as shown in Figure 8.39 (1st Edition 8.43) and Figure 8.40 (1st Edition, 8.44).

    Step 2: Use SQL statements to create the data warehouse table structures (without data) based on the star schema as shown in Figure 8.41 (1st Edition: 8.45) and Figure 8.42 (1st Edition 8.46).

    Step 3: Use SQL statements to populate the data warehouse tables.

    Step 4: Use SQL statements to:

    (a) Compare the ticket amount between male and female, showing the genders and their corresponding amounts.

    (b) Compare the ticket amount by different ticket categories, showing the ticket categories, ticket violation, and the corresponding amounts.

    Please submit an Access file.

**Hint:**

    Itâ€™s a good practice to prepare needed data by query (or queries, several queries can be used for a complex task).
    You may use Union in SQL query to get all Dates from DrivingTicket and ParkingTicket tables.
    You may use Union in SQL query to get the data from two or more tables.
